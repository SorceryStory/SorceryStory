Hello! I'm Joana! I'm a game developer, mainly programmer, though I also do art as a hobby. I love procedural generation and creating tools. My favorite game genres are all kinds of RPGs, Turn-based Strategy, and Colony Sims.

I've worked on game development both as a professional and as an indie. I've created a lot of small games, mostly for gamejams, both alone and with small teams. I've also published Unity tools. More recently I was the sole programmer and technical artist on [Gran Adventure](https://twitter.com/flyhomestudio).
